# Open Source Bug Bounty Workflow

A systematic 5-phase workflow for hunting security vulnerabilities in open source projects using live environment testing and submitting them to HackerOne.

## Workflow Overview

This workflow implements a "bug factory" approach that systematically discovers, validates, and exploits security vulnerabilities using a live testing environment:

1. **Phase 1: Environment Research & Production Setup** - Set up realistic docker-compose environment for testing
2. **Phase 2: Code Recon & Strategic Targeting** - Map the project and spawn domain specialists using live environment
3. **Phase 3: Pattern Discovery & Vulnerability Identification** - Find and test vulnerabilities against live environment
4. **Phase 4: Vulnerability Investigation & Exploitation Planning** - Research and validate exploitability against running system
5. **Phase 5: Exploit Development & HackerOne Submission** - Build working exploits and submit with real evidence

## Key Features

### üéØ Systematic Coverage
- **Domain-Based Exploration**: Security specialists analyze different code areas (auth, input validation, crypto, etc.)
- **CWE Classification**: Every finding gets proper CWE assignment
- **Quality Gates**: Go/no-go decisions prevent wasting time on non-exploitable findings

### üî¨ Professional Investigation
- **Multi-Method Discovery**: Static analysis tools + manual code review
- **Exploitation Research**: WebSearch for latest attack techniques and bypasses
- **Evidence Collection**: Comprehensive proof for HackerOne submissions

### üè≠ Factory Efficiency
- **Tree-Like Expansion**: 1 Phase 1 ‚Üí 4-6 Phase 2 ‚Üí 15-30 Phase 3 ‚Üí 5-10 Phase 4 ‚Üí 3-8 Phase 5
- **Environment-First Testing**: All phases validate against live docker-compose environment
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different domains
- **Coordination**: Memory system shares findings between agents

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from example_workflows.open_source_bug_bounty.phases import BUGBOUNTY_PHASES, BUGBOUNTY_WORKFLOW_CONFIG

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Environment Research & Production Setup

**Purpose**: Set up realistic testing environment for actual vulnerability validation

**Key Activities**:
- Analyze project type and architecture (web app, CLI tool, library, microservices)
- Research production deployment patterns and dependencies
- Create docker-compose.yml with multi-service environment
- Generate realistic sample data and test scenarios
- Document environment access and usage for other phases

**Environment Setup**:
- Docker-based local environment matching real-world deployments
- Sample applications with vulnerable functionality for testing
- Authentication flows and user management systems
- Database, cache, and external service integrations
- Comprehensive documentation for other agents

### Phase 2: Code Recon & Strategic Targeting

**Purpose**: Strategic analysis using live environment insights

**Key Activities**:
- Analyze running environment to understand actual functionality
- Verify project structure against live services

### Phase 4: Vulnerability Investigation & Exploitation Planning

**Purpose**: Research and validate exploitability against live environment

**Key Activities**:
- WebSearch for specific CWE exploitation techniques
- Deep code analysis of vulnerable patterns
- **LIVE VALIDATION**: Test exploitation techniques against running system
- Exploitability assessment based on actual testing (Easy/Medium/Hard/Impossible)
- Go/no-go decision for Phase 5 based on real exploitability

**Exploitability Factors**:
- Live environment accessibility and attack surface
- Security controls validated in running system
- Actual execution context demonstrated in docker-compose
- Real-world security impact proven through testing

### Phase 5: Exploit Development & HackerOne Submission

**Purpose**: Build working exploits against live environment and submit

**Key Activities**:
- Develop reliable Proof of Concept tested against docker-compose
- Collect comprehensive evidence from actual exploitation
- Create professional HackerOne report with real evidence
- Submit via `submit_result` with validated exploitation proof

**Submission Package**:
```

## Best Practices

### For Phase 1 Agents
- Research project type and determine appropriate environment setup
- Create realistic, production-like environments using suitable technologies
- Document environment access and usage clearly
- Ensure services are running and testable for security validation
- Provide comprehensive guides for other phases
- Focus on making vulnerabilities actually testable rather than theoretical

### For Phase 2 Agents
- Leverage the live environment for strategic insights
- Focus on testable vs theoretical vulnerabilities
- Create environment-aware domain analysis
- Provide clear testing objectives for Phase 3 agents
- Coordinate with environment documentation

### For Phase 3 Agents
- Validate findings against the running environment
- Prioritize exploitable over theoretical vulnerabilities
- Test potential vulnerabilities before creating tasks
- Document live test results and evidence
- Only create Phase 4 tasks for confirmed exploitable findings

### For Phase 4 Agents
- Validate exploitation techniques in live environment
- Base go/no-go decisions on actual testing results
- Test attack scenarios against docker-compose services
- Document live environment exploitation evidence
- Focus on what can be actually demonstrated

### For Phase 5 Agents
- Develop exploits that work against the live environment
- Collect real evidence from actual exploitation
- Test exploits multiple times for reliability
- Document live environment details in reproduction steps
- Ensure exploits work consistently against docker-compose

## Configuration

### Environment Setup
```python
sdk = HephaestusSDK(
    phases=BUGBOUNTY_PHASES,
    workflow_config=BUGBOUNTY_WORKFLOW_CONFIG,
    working_directory="/path/to/project",
    llm_provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    llm_model="gpt-4",
    max_concurrent_agents=3,
    monitoring_interval=60,
)
```

### Customization
You can adjust the workflow by:
- Modifying domain priorities in Phase 1
- Adding tool-specific configurations for Phase 2
- Adjusting exploitability thresholds in Phase 3
- Customizing report templates in Phase 4

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Phase 1 Creates Too Many Tasks**: Reduce the number of security domains or combine related areas.

**Phase 2 Finds No Vulnerabilities**: Ensure static analysis tools are properly configured and the project has security-relevant code.

**Phase 3 Rejects All Findings**: Check if exploitability assessment is too strict - consider Medium difficulty as acceptable.

**Phase 4 Exploits Fail**: Verify environment setup matches project requirements and all dependencies are installed.

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```python
sdk = HephaestusSDK(
    log_level="DEBUG",
    monitoring_interval=30,  # More frequent checks
)
```

## Contributing

To extend this workflow:

1. **Add New Security Domains**: Update Phase 1 task creation logic
2. **Support New Languages**: Add tool configurations for Phase 2
