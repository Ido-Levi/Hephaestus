# Allowed Domain Configuration
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to your bug bounty working directory
# 2. Rename it to allowed_domain.txt (remove .template)
# 3. Replace "example.com" below with ONE domain you want to test
#
# WHY ONLY ONE DOMAIN?
# Focusing on one domain at a time allows agents to do deep, thorough
# testing rather than shallow testing across many domains. You can
# always test other domains later by changing this file.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# - api.example.com
# - app.example.com
#
# NOTE: Do NOT include "https://" or paths, just the domain.

example.com
