# Enhanced Result Submission System

The Enhanced Result Submission System allows agents to declare "I found the solution" with automatic validation and configurable workflow termination. This system is designed for workflows that have definitive solutions or completion criteria.

## Overview

### Key Features

- **Workflow-level result submission**: Agents can submit results that represent complete workflow solutions
- **Automatic validation**: Results are validated against configured criteria by specialized validator agents
- **Configurable actions**: Workflows can be configured to terminate or continue when valid results are found
- **Evidence-based validation**: Results must include comprehensive evidence and proof
- **Audit trail**: Complete tracking of result submissions, validations, and workflow actions

### When to Use

Use this system for workflows that have:
- Definitive solutions (e.g., crackme challenges, bug fixes)
- Clear success criteria
- Need to prevent unnecessary work after solution is found
- Require validation of claimed solutions

## Configuration

### phases_config.yaml

Each workflow can include a `phases_config.yaml` file in its phases folder:

```yaml
# Whether this workflow expects a definitive result
has_result: true

# Criteria that submitted results must meet
result_criteria: |
  Must provide:
  1. The correct password or flag
  2. Execution proof showing successful unlock
  3. Method used to find the solution

# Action to take when a valid result is found
on_result_found: stop_all  # or "do_nothing"
```

### Configuration Options

- **has_result**: Boolean indicating whether the workflow expects a definitive result
- **result_criteria**: Detailed criteria for validation (required if has_result=true)
- **on_result_found**: Action to take when a valid result is validated
  - `stop_all`: Terminate all agents and cancel remaining tasks
  - `do_nothing`: Log the result but continue workflow execution

## Usage Flow

### 1. Agent Submission

When an agent believes they have found the solution:

```python
# Via MCP client
submit_result(
    workflow_id="workflow-123",
    markdown_file_path="/path/to/solution.md",
    agent_id="agent-456"
)
```

### 2. Automatic Validation

If the workflow has `has_result: true` and criteria configured:
- A result validator agent is automatically spawned
- The validator reads the result file and evaluates it against criteria
- The validator submits a pass/fail decision with detailed feedback

### 3. Workflow Actions

Based on the validation outcome and configuration:
- **Validation passed + stop_all**: All agents terminated, tasks cancelled, workflow completed
- **Validation passed + do_nothing**: Result logged, workflow continues normally
- **Validation failed**: Result rejected, workflow continues, agents can submit new results

## Result File Format

Results must be submitted as markdown files with comprehensive evidence:

```markdown
# Solution Title

## Solution Statement
Clear statement of what was found/solved

## Primary Evidence
Direct proof that the solution works:
- Execution outputs
- Screenshots
- Test results

## Supporting Evidence
Additional verification:
- Alternative confirmations
- Cross-checks
- Independent validation

## Methodology
Step-by-step explanation of how the solution was discovered

## Reproduction Steps
Instructions for others to verify the result independently

## Confidence Assessment
How certain you are about the solution
```

## Example Workflows

### Crackme Challenge

**Configuration:**
```yaml
has_result: true
result_criteria: |
  Must provide:
  1. The correct password or flag
  2. Execution proof showing successful unlock
  3. Method used to find the solution
on_result_found: stop_all
```

**Expected Result Evidence:**
- Binary analysis methodology
- Password/flag discovery process
- Successful execution screenshot
- Verification of access granted

### Research Task

**Configuration:**
```yaml
has_result: true
result_criteria: |
  Must include:
  1. Comprehensive analysis with 5+ sources
  2. Actionable recommendations
  3. Evidence-based conclusions
on_result_found: do_nothing
```

**Expected Result Evidence:**
- Research methodology
- Source analysis and citations
- Findings summary
- Actionable recommendations with supporting data

### Bug Hunt

**Configuration:**
```yaml
has_result: true
result_criteria: |
  Must demonstrate:
  1. Root cause identified
  2. Fix implemented and tested
  3. All tests passing
on_result_found: stop_all
```

**Expected Result Evidence:**
- Bug analysis and root cause
- Code changes with before/after
- Test results showing fix works
- Regression test verification

## MCP Client Tools

### submit_result

```python
submit_result(
    workflow_id="workflow-123",
    markdown_file_path="/path/to/solution.md",
    agent_id="agent-456"
)
```

Submit a workflow result with evidence for validation.

### submit_result_validation

```python
submit_result_validation(
    result_id="result-456",
    validation_passed=True,
    feedback="Detailed validation feedback",
    evidence=[...],
    validator_agent_id="validator-789"
)
```

Submit validation review for a workflow result (validator agents only).

### get_workflow_results

```python
get_workflow_results(workflow_id="workflow-123")
```

Get all submitted results for a workflow.

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- File paths validated to prevent directory traversal
- Result file size limited to 1MB
- Markdown format validation
- Agent authentication required

### Access Control
- Only workflow agents can submit results
- Only result validator agents can validate results
- Results are immutable once validated
- Workflow termination requires validation

### Audit Trail
- All result submissions logged
- Validation decisions tracked with evidence
- Workflow terminations recorded
- Complete evidence chain maintained

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

- **File not found**: Result file doesn't exist at specified path
- **Workflow not found**: Invalid workflow ID provided
- **Already validated**: Workflow already has a validated result
- **Invalid criteria**: Missing or malformed validation criteria
- **Validator timeout**: Validation agent fails to respond

### Error Recovery

- Failed validations don't affect workflow execution
- Multiple result submissions allowed until one is validated
- Validator failures logged but don't block other operations
- Graceful degradation when validation system unavailable

## Best Practices

### For Result Submissions
1. Include comprehensive evidence in markdown files
2. Test your solution before submitting
3. Provide clear reproduction steps
4. Document your methodology thoroughly
5. Be honest about confidence levels

### for Workflow Configuration
1. Write clear, specific validation criteria
2. Consider whether workflow should stop or continue
3. Test your criteria with example results
4. Provide detailed requirements in criteria text
5. Use appropriate file size limits

### For Result Validation
1. Read the entire result file carefully
2. Check each criterion systematically
3. Provide specific feedback about what passed/failed
4. Include evidence to support your decision
5. Be thorough but fair in evaluation
