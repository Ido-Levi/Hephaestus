## üìñ Recommended Learning Paths

### Path 1: Workflow Designer (Recommended for Most Users)

1. Start with [Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start.md) to understand the basics
2. Read [Phases System](guides/phases-system.md) to learn how workflows work
3. Study [Best Practices](guides/best-practices.md) for design patterns
4. Learn about [Guardian Monitoring](guides/guardian-monitoring.md) and [Ticket Tracking](guides/ticket-tracking.md)
5. Explore [SDK Overview](sdk/overview.md) for Python integration

### Path 2: Contributor / Advanced User

1. Start with [Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start.md) for context
2. Read all [Workflow Design Guides](#designing-workflows)
3. Deep dive into [Core Systems](#core-systems) to understand architecture
4. Review [Advanced Features](#advanced-features)
5. Check [API Reference](#api-reference) for integration

### Path 3: Python Developer

1. [Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start.md) for overview
2. [SDK Overview](sdk/overview.md) for programmatic usage
3. [Defining Phases](sdk/phases.md) for defining workflows in code
4. [SDK Examples](sdk/examples.md) for real-world patterns
5. Reference [Workflow Design Guides](#designing-workflows) as needed

## üéØ Key Concepts

### Phases
Logical stages of problem-solving (reconnaissance ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí validation) that communicate and branch dynamically based on discoveries.

### Guardian
AI-powered monitoring system that analyzes agent trajectories every 60 seconds, ensuring agents stay aligned with their goals and providing steering when needed.

### Tickets
Persistent work items with memory - agents create tickets, move them through Kanban columns, add comments, and resolve them when complete. Perfect for coordinating multi-agent workflows.

### Semi-Structured Workflows
Combine structure (phases, tickets, done definitions) with flexibility (dynamic task spawning, cross-phase branching, adaptive problem-solving).
