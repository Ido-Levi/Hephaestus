Using the approach ticket **ticket\u2011a05d1b63\u2011e633\u20114c42\u201182ac\u20110053adc05484** (child of the main issue **ticket\u2011a979cd20\u2011f952\u20114aff\u2011a342\u20115d6bb67be75d**), run the project\u2019s complete test suite, confirm that the reproduction test and all existing tests now pass, and that no regression is introduced.  Generate a clean Git patch containing only source\u2011code changes, verify that the patch applies cleanly to a pristine checkout and that it does not touch any test files.  Document the test run (commands, full output, pass/fail counts), create the required documentation files (solution_submission.md, reproduction_instructions.md), resolve the approach ticket and the main issue ticket as *solved*, and submit the result via the provided API calls.  If any test fails, mark the approach as *approach\u2011failed*, create a new approach ticket with a revised strategy, and still complete the Phase\u20113 task documentation.",
