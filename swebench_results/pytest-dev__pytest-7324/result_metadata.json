  "task_description": "Run the comprehensive verification for the fix of the Python keyword identifier compilation bug (ticket\u20115961a610\u20119b65\u20114393\u20119ace\u2011c7a1396302c7). The work must include:\n1. Extract the approach ticket ID and its parent (main issue) ticket from the task description.\n2. Execute the full pytest suite (including all tests in the repository) and capture the complete output.\n3. Specifically confirm that the tests in `testing/test_mark_expression.py` that exercise the `-k` and `-m` command\u2011line options succeed.\n4. Ensure that no test files were modified during the fix.\n5. Generate a clean `git diff` patch containing only source\u2011code changes.\n6. Verify that the patch applies cleanly to a pristine checkout and that the test suite still passes after applying it.\n7. Create the required documentation files (`solution_submission.md` and `reproduction_instructions.md`) describing the problem, the fix, and how to reproduce it.\n8. Resolve the approach ticket and the main\u2011issue ticket with appropriate comments, and submit the result via the `mcp__hephaestus__submit_result` call.\n9. Finally, mark the Phase\u20113 task as **done** with a summary of the successful verification.\nIf any test fails, the approach ticket must be marked as **approach\u2011failed**, a new approach ticket created, and the Phase\u20113 task closed with a failure summary (but the current request expects a successful path).",
