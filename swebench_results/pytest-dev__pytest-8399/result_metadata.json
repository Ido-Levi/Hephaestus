  "task_description": "You are to complete **Phase\u202f3 \u2013 Test & Verify Solution** for the fixture\u2011visibility bug. The primary goal is to confirm that the fix implemented in approach ticket **ticket\u201133135157\u2011ccd8\u20114cc1\u2011861f\u2011e2004295c58e** resolves the issue without regressions. This involves:\n1. Extracting the approach ticket ID and its parent (main\u2011issue) ticket ID.\n2. Running the **entire project test suite** (not only the reproduction test) and capturing full output.\n3. Analyzing the results:\n   - If **all tests pass**, generate a clean git\u2011patch that modifies **only source files**, verify the patch applies cleanly on a fresh checkout, re\u2011run the tests to confirm, create the required documentation (reproduction_instructions.md, solution_submission.md), resolve the approach ticket and the main\u2011issue ticket, and submit the result.\n   - If **any test fails**, mark the approach ticket as `approach\u2011failed`, add a detailed comment with failures, create a **new approach ticket** (including a new Phase\u20112 task) that addresses the failure, and update the main\u2011issue ticket with the failure information.\n4. Throughout the process, ensure **no test files are altered**, the patch is non\u2011empty, and all ticket\u2011management calls are performed as prescribed.\n5. Finally, update the Phase\u20113 task status to *done* with a concise summary.\n\nAll actions must obey the SWEBench rules: no test modifications, minimal source changes, patch must apply cleanly, and 100\u202f% test pass is required for success.",
