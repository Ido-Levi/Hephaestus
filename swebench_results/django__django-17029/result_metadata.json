  "task_description": "Execute Phase\u202f3 of the Matplotlib Text antialiasing enhancement workflow. Run the complete project test suite (including the isolated testing harness) to confirm that the Text antialiasing implementation does not introduce any regressions. Verify that all Text\u2011related functionality, annotation inheritance, and backend compatibility continue to work. Produce a detailed test report that includes command lines, full stdout/stderr, pass/fail counts, and any failures. Confirm that the isolated\u2011testing strategy is valid and can serve as a foundation for future antialiasing work. Finally, ensure the test harness itself is functional (i.e., it can be run independently) and document the validation steps.",
