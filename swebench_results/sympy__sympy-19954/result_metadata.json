  "task_description": "You are in Phase\u202f3 (Testing & Verification) for the bug\u2011fix approach identified by ticket **ticket\u20115e550893\u2011e68d\u2011465a\u2011b659\u201155e4d2f5282b** (the List\u2011Rebuilding Strategy that fixed the `minimal_blocks()` IndexError). Your job is to fully validate this solution:\n\n1. **Extract tickets** \u2013 pull the approach ticket ID from the task description and retrieve its parent (the main issue ticket).  \n2. **Run the complete test suite** \u2013 execute the project's full set of tests (e.g., `pytest -q` or the project\u2011specific command). Capture the full console output, total number of tests, and pass/fail counts.\n3. **Analyse results** \u2013 confirm that:\n   - All original tests pass (no regression).\n   - The reproduction test for `DihedralGroup(18)` and `DihedralGroup(50)` now passes.\n   - No new failures appear.\n4. **If all tests pass**:\n   - Verify that no test files were modified (run `git status` and check for any `test*` paths).\n   - Generate a clean git diff patch (`git diff > solution.patch`).\n   - Confirm the patch is non\u2011empty and contains **only source\u2011code changes**.\n   - Validate the patch can be applied cleanly to a fresh checkout and that the test suite still passes after applying it.\n   - Create `reproduction_instructions.md` describing how to reproduce the bug before the fix and how to verify the fix after applying the patch.\n   - Create `solution_submission.md` that documents the problem, the fix, full test\u2011suite output, before/after reproduction evidence, and embeds the full patch.\n   - Resolve the approach ticket (status\u202f=\u202f\"solved\") and the main issue ticket (status\u202f=\u202f\"resolved\"), attaching the solution markdown and patch as evidence.\n   - Call the `mcp__hephaestus__submit_result` API with the markdown and extra files.\n   - Mark the Phase\u202f3 task as **done** with a summary of success.\n5. **If any test fails**:\n   - Add a detailed comment to the approach ticket explaining the failures.\n   - Change the approach ticket status to **\"approach-failed\"**.\n   - Create a new approach ticket that proposes an alternative strategy (must include a clear plan based on the observed failures).\n   - Create a new Phase\u202f2 task for the new approach.\n   - Update the main issue ticket with a comment noting the failure and the new approach.\n   - Save the failure analysis to memory.\n   - Mark the current Phase\u202f3 task as **done** with a summary of the failure and the newly created approach.\n\nAll actions must obey the SWEBench rules: **no test files may be edited**, the patch must apply cleanly, and **100\u202f% of tests must pass** before the solution is considered successful.",
