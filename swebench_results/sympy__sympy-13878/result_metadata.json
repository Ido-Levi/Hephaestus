  "task_description": "You are in Phase\u202f3 (Testing\u202f&\u202fVerification) for the approach ticket **TICKET: ticket\u2011c85d05c5\u20111d8b\u20114cd8\u2011868c\u2011cf9934cb259b**. Your job is to:\n1. Extract the approach ticket ID from the task description and retrieve the associated main\u2011issue ticket.\n2. Run the **full project test suite** (not just the reproduction test) and capture the complete command, stdout, stderr, and pass/fail statistics.\n3. Analyze the results:\n   - If **all tests pass**, verify that the bug is fixed, generate a clean `solution.patch` containing **only source\u2011code changes** (no test files), confirm the patch applies cleanly on a fresh repo, and re\u2011run the tests to ensure the patch still passes.\n   - Create `reproduction_instructions.md` describing how to reproduce the bug before the patch and how to verify the fix after applying the patch.\n   - Create `solution_submission.md` summarising the problem, the fix, test results, and embedding the full diff.\n   - Resolve the approach ticket and the main\u2011issue ticket, add appropriate comments, and call `mcp__hephaestus__submit_result` with the generated markdown and extra files.\n4. If **any test fails**, mark the approach ticket as `approach\u2011failed` with a detailed comment explaining which tests failed and why, add a comment to the main\u2011issue ticket, save a memory entry with the failure analysis, and **create a new approach ticket** plus a new Phase\u20112 task to continue exploration.\n5. Finally, update the Phase\u20113 task status to `done` with a concise summary of what happened (success or failure). All actions must follow the strict SWEBench rules (no test\u2011file modifications, patch must apply cleanly, 100\u202f% test pass).",
