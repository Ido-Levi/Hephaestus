  "task_description": "You are in Phase\u202f3 of the SWEBench workflow.  The goal is to **verify the implementation for ticket\u201165102f0b\u201181dd\u2011472e\u201195d5\u201158c3dd09f586**, decide whether it passes or fails, and take the appropriate follow\u2011up actions.\n\n**Core steps**\n1. **Extract tickets** \u2013 Parse the task description to obtain the approach ticket ID (ticket\u201165102f0b\u2011\u2026) and retrieve its record as well as the parent main\u2011issue ticket.\n2. **Run the full test suite** \u2013 Execute the project's complete test command (e.g., `pytest -q`). Capture the full console output, total number of tests, passed/failed counts, and any traceback.\n3. **Analyse results** \u2013 Determine whether *all* tests (including the reproduction tests for the InheritDocstrings property bug) pass.\n4. **Success path** (all tests pass):\n   - Verify that **no test files have been modified** in the working tree.\n   - Generate a clean Git diff (`git diff > solution.patch`).\n   - Confirm the patch contains only source\u2011code changes and applies cleanly to a fresh checkout.\n   - Re\u2011run the tests **after applying the patch** to guarantee they still pass.\n   - Create two markdown artefacts:\n     * `reproduction_instructions.md` \u2013 detailed steps to reproduce the bug *before* the patch and to verify the fix *after* the patch.\n     * `solution_submission.md` \u2013 full report (problem summary, solution overview, test logs, before/after evidence, and the patch in fenced\u2011code format).\n   - Resolve the **approach ticket** (status\u202f=\u202fsolved) with a comment summarising the successful verification.\n   - Resolve the **main\u2011issue ticket** (status\u202f=\u202fsolved) with a concise description of the fix and a link to the patch.\n   - Submit the result via `mcp__hephaestus__submit_result`, attaching `solution.patch`, `reproduction_instructions.md`, and `solution_submission.md`.\n   - Mark the Phase\u202f3 task as **done** with a success summary.\n5. **Failure path** (any test fails):\n   - Mark the approach ticket as **approach\u2011failed** with a detailed comment containing total/failed counts and failure diagnostics.\n   - Add a comment to the main\u2011issue ticket explaining the failure.\n   - Save a memory entry summarising what went wrong.\n   - **Create a new approach ticket** (with a fresh hypothesis) and a corresponding Phase\u202f2 task to continue investigation.\n   - Mark the current Phase\u202f3 task as **done** (failure path) and reference the newly created approach ticket.\n\nAll actions must obey the SWEBench rules: *no test files may be changed*, the patch must apply cleanly, and the full test suite must pass before any ticket is resolved as solved.",
