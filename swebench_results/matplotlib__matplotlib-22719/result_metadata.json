  "task_description": "You are in Phase\u202f3 (Testing & Verification) for the Matplotlib deprecation\u2011warning bug. The assigned approach ticket is **ticket\u20111023248f\u20119dcc\u2011458e\u201199f7\u2011b8bf6f246ef3**. Your job is to run the **full project test suite**, confirm that the fix (early\u2011return for empty arrays in `lib/matplotlib/category.py`) works without regressions, generate a clean Git patch, create the required documentation (reproduction instructions and solution report), update both the approach ticket and its parent issue ticket, and finally submit the result. If any test fails, you must mark the approach as *approach\u2011failed*, document the failures, and create a **new approach ticket** with a fresh Phase\u20112 task before marking this Phase\u20113 task as done. All actions must obey the SWEBench rules: no test\u2011file modifications, patch must apply cleanly, and all tickets must be correctly updated.",
