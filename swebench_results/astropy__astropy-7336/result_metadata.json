  "task_description": "Run the comprehensive test suite for the repository, verify that the fix for the `@u.quantity_input` None\u2011return\u2011annotation bug works and does not cause regressions, generate a clean git patch (containing only source\u2011code changes), create full documentation (reproduction instructions and solution report), resolve the approach ticket and its parent issue ticket, submit the result, and finally mark the Phase\u20113 task as done. If any test fails, mark the approach as *approach\u2011failed*, create a new approach ticket with a Phase\u20112 task, and update the main issue accordingly.",
