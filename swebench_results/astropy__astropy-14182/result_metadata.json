  "task_description": "You are to complete Phase\u202f3 (Testing\u202f&\u202fVerification) for the RST\u202fheader_rows fix. The steps are:\n1. **Extract tickets** \u2013 parse the task description to obtain the approach ticket ID (`ticket-4bcd9080-9891-4640-9f6c-0537a04e1a6e`) and its parent (main\u2011issue) ticket.\n2. **Run the full test suite** \u2013 execute `pytest astropy/io/ascii/tests/test_rst.py astropy/io/ascii/tests/test_fixedwidth.py` (and any additional project\u2011wide tests) while capturing the complete console output.\n3. **Analyze results** \u2013 confirm that:\n   - All existing tests pass (no regression).\n   - The reproduction tests that originally failed now succeed.\n4. **If all tests pass**:\n   - Verify that no test files were modified.\n   - Generate a clean Git diff (`solution.patch`).\n   - Confirm the patch applies cleanly to a fresh checkout and that the tests still pass after applying it.\n   - Create `reproduction_instructions.md` describing how to reproduce the bug before the patch and how to verify the fix after the patch.\n   - Create `solution_submission.md` containing problem summary, solution overview, full test output, before/after evidence, code\u2011quality checks, and the patch.\n   - Resolve the approach ticket (status\u202f=\u202fresolved) with a detailed success comment.\n   - Resolve the main\u2011issue ticket (status\u202f=\u202fresolved) with a summary comment and, if possible, the commit SHA.\n   - Call `mcp__hephaestus__submit_result` with the markdown file, patch, and reproduction guide.\n   - Mark the Phase\u202f3 task as **done**.\n5. **If any test fails**:\n   - Add a comment to the approach ticket marking it `approach\u2011failed` and include full failure details.\n   - Add a comment to the main\u2011issue ticket explaining the failure and that further work is required.\n   - Save the failure analysis to memory.\n   - Create a new approach ticket (and a corresponding Phase\u202f2 task) that addresses the uncovered problems.\n   - Mark the Phase\u202f3 task as **done** (failed path).\n\nAll actions must be performed using the provided MCP functions (e.g., `mcp__hephaestus__add_ticket_comment`, `mcp__hephaestus__resolve_ticket`, `mcp__hephaestus__submit_result`, `mcp__hephaestus__update_task_status`). No test files may be altered, and the generated patch must be non\u2011empty and apply cleanly.",
