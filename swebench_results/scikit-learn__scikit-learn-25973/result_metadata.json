  "task_description": "Execute Phase\u202f3 of the bug\u2011fix workflow for the SequentialFeatureSelector CV iterator issue. Using the approach ticket **ticket-bdbd299b-8ec0-4796-bcad-0426174092fc**, run the project's complete test suite, verify that the original bug is resolved and no regressions are introduced, and generate a clean Git patch. If all tests pass, resolve both the approach ticket and the main issue ticket, submit the solution documentation and the patch. If any test fails, mark the approach ticket as **approach\u2011failed**, provide a detailed failure analysis, create a new approach ticket and a corresponding Phase\u20112 task, and update the main issue ticket accordingly. All actions must follow the strict SWEBench rules (no test file modifications, patch must apply cleanly, and all documentation must be produced).",
